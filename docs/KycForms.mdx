# KycForms Component Documentation

## Overview

The `KycForms` component is used to manage and handle KYC (Know Your Customer) data. It supports two types of forms: Individual and Entity. Each form has different fields that are relevant to the type of the form. For 'Entity' forms, you can add multiple 'Beneficial Owners'.

## Props

- `type` - A string indicating the type of form to display. It can be either "individual" or "entity".

## Example Usage

<CodeBlock language="tsx">
  {`<KycForms type="individual" />`}
</CodeBlock>

## FormType

<InlineCode>FormType</InlineCode> is a string type that can be either "individual" or "entity", corresponding to the type of KYC form.

## FormData

<InlineCode>FormData</InlineCode> is a union type of `KycIndividual` or `KycEntity`, representing the data for an individual or entity form respectively.

## KycIndividual

`KycIndividual` is an object that represents the data of an individual KYC form. It contains the following fields:

- `formType` - The type of the form, in this case "individual".
- `firstName` - The first name of the individual.
- `lastName` - The last name of the individual.
- `dateOfBirth` - The date of birth of the individual.

## KycEntity

`KycEntity` is an object that represents the data of an entity KYC form. It contains the following fields:

- `formType` - The type of the form, in this case "entity".
- `entityName` - The name of the entity.

- `beneficials` - An array of `KycBeneficial` objects, representing the beneficial owners of the entity.

## KycBeneficial

`KycBeneficial` is an object that represents a beneficial owner in an entity form. It is used in the `KycEntity`'s `beneficials` array. The structure is similar to `KycEntity` but fields are prefixed with `beneficial`.

## FormInput Component

The `FormInput` component is used to create individual form fields. The props it takes are:

- `label` - The label text for the input field.
- `type` - The type of the input field, typically "text".
- `value` - The current value of the input field.
- `onChange` - A function to call when the value of the input field changes.

## Helper Functions

- `isKycEntity` - A type guard function to check if a `FormData` object is of type `KycEntity`.
- `addBeneficialOwnerToState` - Adds a new beneficial owner to the state.
- `updateBeneficialOwnerInState` - Updates a beneficial owner in the state.
- `removeBeneficialOwnerFromState` - Removes a beneficial owner from the state.
- `handleInputChange` - Handles the change of an input field in the form.
- `handleFormTypeChange` - Switches the form type between "individual" and "entity".
- `handleSubmit` - Submits the form, currently just logging the form data.
- `handleBeneficialFormDelete` - Removes a beneficial owner form.

## Layout

The form is laid out in a grid fashion, and is responsive, centering the form on the page. For entity forms, there's an 'Add Beneficial Owner' button to add a new beneficial owner form, and each beneficial owner form has a 'Delete' button to remove it. The form has a 'Submit' button to submit the form data.
