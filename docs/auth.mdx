# Authentication Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of our authentication setup in the project. 

## Server Side

On the server-side, we use the NextAuth.js library for handling authentication. The configuration file can be found in [`...nextauth]/route.ts`](../path/to/your/route.ts).

### Providers

For the authentication provider, we are using the `CredentialsProvider` from NextAuth. This provider allows users to sign in using their Ethereum wallet, i.e., Web3 authentication.

<CodeBlock>
{`CredentialsProvider({
  id: "web3",
  name: "Sign In With Ethereum",
  credentials: {
    message: { label: "Message", type: "text" },
    signature: { label: "Signed Message", type: "text" }, // aka signature
  },
  async authorize(credentials, req) {
    // ...authorization logic
  },
})`}
</CodeBlock>

### User and Session Handling

The `authorize` function is responsible for user authentication and creating new users if needed. In this function, the Ethereum message and signature are first verified using the `siwe` library. 

If verification is successful, the function checks whether a user with the given Ethereum address already exists in the database using Prisma. If the user does not exist, a new user entry is created. 

The JWT callback takes the user data and assigns the user's id to the `sub` property. 

The session callback then takes the token and assigns the user's id, role, merchant, operator, and token to the session user. 

<CodeBlock>
{`jwt({ token, user }) {
  // ...jwt logic
},

session({ session, token, user }) {
  // ...session logic
},`}
</CodeBlock>

### Authentication types

The auth types are defined in [`types/auth.d.ts`](types/auth.d.ts), where we have interfaces for `Session`, `User`, `AuthenticatedUser`, `Merchant`, and `Operator`.

## Client Side

The user-facing part of the authentication process is handled in [`_providers/walletconnect`](app/_providers/walletconnect/*).

### Login Component

`Login` component handles the login UI and the interactions with the WalletConnect client, which is initialized in the `WalletConnectProvider`. 

### WalletConnect Provider

The WalletConnectProvider uses the WalletConnect `Client` and provides its state and methods through a context to the `Login` component.

## QR Code Authentication

For the actual sign-in process with WalletConnect, we have another client-side file [`Sign In With Ethereum`](app/components/home/siwe.tsx).

The WalletConnectProvider exports a context that provides methods for connecting and disconnecting WalletConnect sessions, state variables for the current state of the WalletConnect client and session, and some other utility states and functions.

The QR code for the WalletConnect pairing proposal is generated during the `connect` method of the WalletConnectProvider. The `uri` for the QR code is one of the return values of the `client.connect` method from WalletConnect client.
